# Polish-doughnut tori around rotating neutron stars

This notebook and the results contained in it are an essential part of the following article and should be referred to when using it or parts of it:

Matuszková et al. (Paper I, submitted).

The notebook containts a full general relativistic analytic solution describing a radiation-pressure supported equilibrium fluid torus orbiting a rotating neutron star, the space-time of which is described by the Hartle-Thorne metric [1,2]. Functions for calculating important quantities of the metric and the shape of the equipotential surfaces for given parameters are included. The calculations of a torus surface follows Abramowicz et al. 2006, Blaes et al. 2006 and Horák et al. 2017 [3-5]. The calculations of a neutron star surface are based on Urbanec et al. 2013 [6].
