This Notebook containts a full general relativistic analytic solution for a radiation-pressure supported equilibrium fluid torus orbiting a rotating neutron star, the space-time of which is described by the Hartle-Thorne metric. 
The calculations of a torus surface are based on:
Abramowicz et al. 2006 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006CQGra..23.1689A/abstract)
Blaes et al. 2006 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.369.1235B/abstract)
Horák et al. 2017 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017bhns.work...47H/abstract).

The calculations of a neutron star surface are based on Urbanec et al. 2013 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.433.1903U/abstract)

The implied explicit formulae describing the full solution for the accretion tori in the Hartle-Thorne spacetime are rather complicated to fit within a research paper.
We provide their complete version in a Wolfram Mathematica notebook, which contains functions for calculating important quantities of the metric and the shape of the equipotential surfaces for given parameters. 

The notebook is an essential part of paper Matuszková et al. (submitted)
